**CNN-based Visual Encoder + Text Encoder + Temporal Fusion + Caption & Image-Feature Prediction**

This project implements a **lightweight multimodal deep learning system** for story-sequence reasoning:

* Input: a sequence of **images + captions**
* Model learns to:
  ✓ Generate the **next caption**
  ✓ Predict the **next image feature** (representation of last frame)

The architecture is designed for **efficient notebook training**, replacing heavy pretrained encoders with a notebook-friendly **lightweight CNN**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✔ Lightweight Visual Encoder (Custom CNN)

* Replaces heavy ResNet50/ViT
* Faster training, stable gradients, ideal for Colab/Jupyter
* 512-dim image embeddings

### ✔ Text Encoder (LSTM)

* Tokenized captions → 512-dim embedding

### ✔ Temporal Fusion

Per-frame fused representation:

```
TimeDistributed(VisualEncoder) + TimeDistributed(TextEncoder)
       → Dense → LSTM → Context Vector
```

### ✔ Two Decoders

1. **Text Decoder** — teacher forcing, generates next-frame caption
2. **Image-Feature Decoder** — predicts the CNN feature vector for final image

### ✔ Robust Training Loop (Notebook-Friendly)

Includes:

* Correct **token-level accuracy**
* Three forms of **sequence accuracy**:

  * `seq_strict` = strict token-id exact match
  * `seq_norm` = normalized text exact match (lowercase, punctuation removed)
  * `seq_fuzzy` = BLEU-based soft matching
* Handles **padding**, **empty caption repair**, and **stable loss**
* Step-level history saved to `results/loss_history.json`

### ✔ Evaluation Metrics

Automatically computes:

* BLEU
* ROUGE-L
* strict / normalized / fuzzy sequence accuracy
  All stored in `results/eval_metrics.json`.

## 🧪 Notebook-Friendly Training (Recommended)

### Training cell features:

* Handles **padding repair**
* Tracks correct **token-level accuracy**
* Computes three types of **sequence accuracy**
* Stores per-step training logs
* Runs evaluation on random samples

### Evaluation cell includes:

* Greedy decoding
* BLEU / ROUGE-L
* Normalized text exact-match
* Fuzzy BLEU-based match
* Saves metrics to `results/eval_metrics.json`

### Plot loss + accuracy curves (from saved JSON)

Notebook includes:

* Loss curve (total/text/image)
* Token accuracy curve
* Strict / normalized / fuzzy seq accuracy curves

## 📊 Metrics Explained

### Token Accuracy

Percentage of non-pad tokens predicted correctly.

### Strict Sequence Accuracy

A sequence counts as correct only if **every non-pad token** matches exactly.
→ Very harsh; usually near 0 early in training.

### Normalized Sequence Accuracy

Predictions and targets normalized by:

* Lowercasing
* Removing punctuation
* Collapsing whitespace

More realistic for story captions.





## 🛠 Extending the Model

You can easily extend:

* Swap CNN → MobileNetV2 / EfficientNet
* Add attention over frames
* Add transformer caption decoder
* Add CLIP loss for image-text alignment
